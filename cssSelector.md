## What are they?

CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements you want to style. They are created in a seperate CSS file linked in the head of the HTML file.

## Five Categories of CSS Selectors
* Simple Selectors
* Combinator Selectors
* Pseudo-Class Selectors
* Pseudo-Element Selectors
* Attribute Slectors

> CSS gives developers control over the visual appearance of a website  or app

## CSS Syntax
```css
p {
    color: dark-blue;
}
```
1. **p**: the selector
2. **{}**: declaration block that applies css to the specified selector
3. **color**: the property
4. **value**: the value
